        "Implementing a neural network using the low-level TensorFlow API is a good way to understand how TensorFlow works, but it's a little inconvenient - we had to manually keep track of all Tensors holding learnable parameters. This was fine for a small network, but could quickly become unweildy for a large complex model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fortunately TensorFlow 2.0 provides higher-level APIs such as tf.keras which make it easy to build models out of modular, object-oriented layers. Further, TensorFlow 2.0 uses eager execution that evaluates operations immediately, without explicitly constructing any computational graphs. This makes it easy to write and debug models, and reduces the boilerplate code.\n",

        "In the initializer __init__() for your new class, define all the layers you need as class attributes. The tf.keras.layers package provides many common neural-network layers, like tf.keras.layers.Dense for fully-connected layers and tf.keras.layers.Conv2D for convolutional layers. Under the hood, these layers will construct Variable Tensors for any learnable parameters. Warning: Don't forget to call super(YourModelName, self).__init__() as the first line in your initializer!\n",
        "Implement the call() method for your class; this implements the forward pass of your model, and defines the connectivity of your network. Layers defined in __init__() implement __call__() so they can be used as function objects that transform input Tensors into output Tensors. Don't define any new layers in call(); any layers you want to use in the forward pass should be defined in __init__().\n",

In addition to multiplying their input by a weight matrix and adding a bias vector, these layer can also apply a nonlinearity for you. For the first layer we specify a ReLU activation function by passing activation='relu' to the constructor; the second layer uses softmax activation function. Finally, we use tf.keras.layers.Flatten to flatten the output from the previous fully-connected layer."

        "Once you have found some sets of parameters that seem to work, search more finely around these parameters. You may need to train for more epochs.\n",
